// Explanation of the code:
// Here is the list of explanations for the different sections of code in this folder.
// The files are:
// - manifest.json
// - background.js
// - content.js
// - popup.js
//
// In manifest.json, the "manifest_version" is set to 3.
// The "permissions" are set to "contextMenus", this is used to create a context menu, i.e. the right click menu.

// In background.js, there are two functions:
// - onInstalled(): this function is called when the extension is installed.
// The function addListener() is used to listen for the "onInstalled" event.
// - onClicked(): this function is called when the user clicks on the context menu.
// The function addListener() is used to listen for the "onClicked" event.

// In content.js, there is a function:
// - onMessage(): this function is called when the extension receives a message from the background script.
// The function chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener() is used to listen for messages from the background script.

// In popup.js, there are two functions:
// - onclick(): this function is called when the user clicks the button.
// The function addEventListener() is used to add an event listener to the button element.


// In-depth explanation of the functions:
// addEventListener() in general takes three arguments:
// - the event name
// - the function to be called when the event is triggered
// - a boolean value that determines whether the function is called in the capturing phase or the bubbling phase.
// The capturing phase is when the event is triggered from the top to the bottom of the DOM tree.
// The bubbling phase is when the event is triggered from the bottom to the top of the DOM tree.
